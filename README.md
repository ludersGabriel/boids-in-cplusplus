Alt-ABOUT
---------

## Boids Algorithm is a algorithm used to describe the movement and formations of boid-like creatures, like flocking birds, some especies of fish and so on.
  - I implemented this version using C++ and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php), a library that provides low-level access to a computers interface, like screen, mouse and graphics hardware. 
  - I followed the especifications from http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html and implemented my own vector2 library, wich is also available in this github directory or on its own directory.
